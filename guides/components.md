# Components in WebGLStudio

LiteScene, the engine used by WebGLStudio, is a component based engine.

That means that any action performed by the system, like rendering on the screen, adding lights, applying postprocessing effects, 
or executing scripts, comes from one of the many components.

Components are attached to the nodes in the scene to extend the properties of every node, this way the system is very modular and easy to extend.

For a better understanding of components, check the [LiteScene Components Guide](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js/blob/master/guides/components.md)
